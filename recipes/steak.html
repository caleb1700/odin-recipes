    <H1>Kb's Steak Recipe</H1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>Steak</ul>
        <ul>Butter</ul>
        <ul>Thyme</ul>
        <ul>garlic</ul>
        <ul>Salt</ul>
        <ul>Pepper</ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            1. Prep the Steak. (Room Temperature & Seasoning)
            Take the steak out of the fridge 30-60 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature.
            Pat it dry with a paper towel for a perfect sear.
            Generously season both sides with salt and black pepper. </p>
            <p>2. Heat the Pan & Sear the Steak
            Use a cast-iron skillet or heavy pan. Heat it over high heat until smoking hot.
            Add a tiny bit of oil (optional) and place the steak in the pan.
            Do not move it for 2-3 minutes—let it develop a crust.
            Flip and sear the other side for another 2-3 minutes.</p>
            <p>3. Add Butter, Garlic, and Thyme (Basting)
            Reduce heat to medium-low.
            Add butter, smashed garlic, and thyme to the pan.
            Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the steak by continuously pouring the melted butter over the top. Do this for 1-2 minutes.</p>
            <p>4. Check for Doneness & Rest the Steak
            Use a meat thermometer to check:
            Rare: 120-125°F (49-52°C)
            Medium-Rare: 130-135°F (54-57°C)
            Medium: 140-145°F (60-63°C)
            Medium-Well: 150-155°F (65-68°C)
            Well-Done: 160°F+ (70°C+)
            Remove from the pan and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.</p>
            <p>Pro Tips:
            Use thick-cut steaks (at least 1-inch thick) for best results.
            Don’t overcrowd the pan—cook one steak at a time if needed.
            Always rest the steak so the juices redistribute.
